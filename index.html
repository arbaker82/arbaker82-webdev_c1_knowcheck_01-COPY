            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Hi, I'm Adam!  I've been around the sun 41 times so far and reside in Eubank, KY.  I have a doggo named "Ruby-Doo".  I love animals, technology, audio engineering and drumming.  To say the least I have been interested in computing and tech my entire life.  Even though I am new to coding I have been building computers, installing linux distros and generally being a geek since the mid 90s.  I've spent most of my adult life working in healthcare, specifically with people that have traumatic brain injuries and trauma ICU direct care.  I am excited to learn more about coding and build some cool stuff!</p>
